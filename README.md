## About

bit-trader is a simple bitcoin and altcoin trading bot / bot-platform for the exchange [Kraken](http://kraken.com).
It isn't affilated or related to Payward, Inc. (the company behind kraken), kraken was just the first exchange to be implemented.

The whole project is currently very alpha-ish but I have the base "micro-trades"-strategy already running on my account and it already produces some money.

Since the whole thing is work-in-progress, currently there is no getting started but developers familiar with nodejs should be able to start it easely.
